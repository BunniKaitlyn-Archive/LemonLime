# LemonLime [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/68va8fo3ivscnu2j/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Cyuubii/ctremulator/branch/master)
A Nintendo 3DS LLE emulator written in C#, ~~don't expect anything to work for quite awhile~~.

The BootROM (Boot9) has started showing signs of life, it tries to access CONFIG9 IO, PXI IO, TIMER IO, IRQ IO and HID IO.

We also have an official Discord server for development: https://discord.gg/aKjJTMd
