# LemonLime [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/68va8fo3ivscnu2j/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Cyuubii/ctremulator/branch/master)
A Nintendo 3DS LLE emulator written in C#, ~~don't expect anything to work for quite awhile~~.

The BootROM (Boot9 / Boot11) has started showing signs of life, they seem to access a few IO registers.

We also have an official Discord server for development: https://discord.gg/aKjJTMd
